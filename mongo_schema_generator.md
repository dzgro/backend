üìò MongoDB Schema Extractor with Compound Index Relationships
üöÄ Overview

This project provides a Python utility to automatically extract and document the schema of your MongoDB database.

Unlike traditional schema extraction, this script is designed for:

Compound Index Aware Analysis ‚Üí Uses compound indexes (e.g. { uid: 1, marketplace: 1, date: 1 }) to explore data in meaningful ways.

Progressive Document Sampling ‚Üí Fetches sample documents grouped by each part of compound indexes, ensuring a comprehensive picture of your data.

Relationship Discovery ‚Üí Infers potential relationships across collections based on:

Single index fields (uid)

Multi-field compound prefixes (uid + marketplace)

Schema Output ‚Üí Produces a JSON file summarizing:

Collections

Index definitions

Possible relationships

Representative sample documents

This schema can be used for:

Understanding large MongoDB deployments

Bootstrapping AI assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) with your data model

Designing query builders, APIs, or migrations

üìÇ Features

‚úÖ List all collections and indexes

‚úÖ Extract sample documents using compound index fields

‚úÖ Infer relationships between collections (based on index prefixes)

‚úÖ Provide progress updates while running

‚úÖ Export schema to JSON for Copilot & AI integration

‚öôÔ∏è Example Relationship Extraction

For a compound index:

{ "uid": 1, "marketplace": 1, "date": 1 }

The script will generate relationships:

"relationships": [
{ "fields": ["uid"], "compound": false },
{ "fields": ["uid", "marketplace"], "compound": true },
{ "fields": ["uid", "marketplace", "date"], "compound": true }
]

This means:

Documents may relate to others by uid

Or by (uid, marketplace) pairs

Or by (uid, marketplace, date)

üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-org/mongo-schema-extractor.git
cd mongo-schema-extractor

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables in .env:

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net
DATABASE_NAME=my_database

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the script with environment variables:

python extract_schema.py

Or pass parameters explicitly:

python extract_schema.py \
 --mongo-uri "mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net" \
 --database my_database

üìä Output

The script generates schema.json like:

{
"collection": "orders",
"indexes": ["uid_1_marketplace_1_date_1"],
"relationships": [
{ "fields": ["uid"], "compound": false },
{ "fields": ["uid", "marketplace"], "compound": true },
{ "fields": ["uid", "marketplace", "date"], "compound": true }
],
"sample_documents": [
{
"uid": "U123",
"marketplace": "IN",
"date": "2025-08-18",
"total": 599.0
}
]
}

üîó Next Steps

Use the schema.json with GitHub Copilot or AI tools by pasting it into their context ‚Üí they will better understand your MongoDB structure.

Extend the relationship logic to support cross-collection inference (e.g., if both orders and users share uid, they‚Äôre related).

Add visual schema diagrams for quicker comprehension.

‚ö° With this, you‚Äôll have a living schema explorer for your MongoDB, always aligned with your compound indexes and relationships.
